## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This project have made the concept of CSS grid more easy for me. I was struggling with it in a previous project which I left working on, but now that I know about CSS grid, I will be continuing to work upon it!

### Continued development

There was a small issue which I faced while working upon the project, which was, I could not center the page, both, vertically and horizontally, but then I solved the issue for horizontally centering the page which was manipulating the width of the conatiner, but I couldn't fix the vertical centering issue; now I assume it could be because the whole page was in a container and I applied the flexbox property on the components of the whole container.

I would definitely overcome this issue in the future project with adding a container for the main body and then applying the flexbox property onto it and leaving the footer.
